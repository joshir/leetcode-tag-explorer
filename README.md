# lc-tag-explorer

This is an in-memory map of leetcode.com problem stats based on json objects retrieved from the browser console (Please don't ask me for the json files. You will need to get a premium subscribtion for yourself to scrape problem stats for your personal use.) 

# proposed features
1. expose this api using graphql? (may be) 
2. expose a REST api with the ability to query problems by `company`, `tag`, `difficulty`, and `frequency` and other combinations that leetcode does not currently offer even to premium users. (yes)
3. create a simple client app in the browser to explore this data (may be)
4. rewrite this in `TypeScript` and create a chrome problem to display problem stats. (may be) Follow up question: can we possibly use this to explore leetcode's data store in the browser further?
